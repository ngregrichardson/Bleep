# Bleep ![Build](https://github.com/ngregrichardson/Bleep/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

### About
I thought of Bleep on my drive to school one day. I had been without a project for a few days and I was itching to start on a new one. I created the functionality over the next few weeks, but once summer started, I started working on other things and never finished the front end. A year later, as I was ending my first year of college, I decided to finish up some old projects: including Bleep. There are four simple steps to use Bleep.

### Usage
1. Upload Your Video
   - This is where you upload your video file. The audio will be extracted from the video and searched for the selected words.
2. Custom Sound Effect
   - You have the option to upload a custom sound file that will be used in place of any selected words. You can skip this step to use the default bleep.
3. Blacklist Words
   - You can choose from our default list of common swear words and add or remove your own to customize it for your audience.
4. Download Your Video
   - The rest is on us! Once that progress bar hits 100% and you see a green checkmark, your file is ready to be downloaded.
